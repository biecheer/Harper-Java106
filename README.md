  *    1.  State
  *    2.  County
  *    3.  Java106Driver
  *
  * To run/test your code in BlueJ all you have to do is
  *
  * 1.  Compile all classes
  * 2.  Right click on the Java106Driver class
  * 3.  select the void main{String [] args} method
  * 4.  Click OK
  * 5.  see the results
  * 
  * To clear out the results between runs just select the Options menu and click on Clear.
  * 
  * Also, please remember to not get hung up on the other pieces of code, this is really 
  * meant to review the concept of LOOPs.  However, if you want to see examples of 
  * getters/setters/constructors of classes the State and County class can be reviewed.
  * 
  * Good luck on the midterm !!!!!
